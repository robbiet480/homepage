#### MeinAuto local Platform

The Internet stands for free and open information. For all, above all. Above all, local dealers, including car dealers, notice this. Customers inform themselves online down to the smallest detail, book test drives at the car dealership around the corner, but then buy again online, because the prices are just unbeatable. MeinAuto GmbH has recognised this problem and would like to involve local dealers more actively again. This is the motivation for the MeinAuto local Platform. If desired, interested parties can be forwarded directly to local dealers.

#### Linux Kernel Module for an Real-Time WiFi Protocol

In his [dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301753247_Isochronous_Wireless_Network_for_Real-time_Communication_in_Industrial_Automation) [Dr.-Ing. Henning Trsek](https://www.hs-owl.de/init/das-init/team/c/trsek.html) deals with the development of a wireless network protocol with properties of hard real-time. This protocol, called isoMAC, consists of TDMA-based media access control and dynamic resource allocation. To test this protocol in use with other TDMA-based protocols (here [Profinet](https://www.profibus.com/technology/profinet/)), a Linux kernel module was developed which synchronizes the time and data of the two communication systems.

The project is also my final thesis and was finished under the title "Development of a Linux kernel module to synchronise time domains for an optimised communication of TDMA-based communication protocols" (original: "Entwicklung eines Linux-Kernel Moduls zur Synchronisation zweier Zeitdomänen für eine optimierte Kommunikation von auf TDMA-basierten Kommunikationsprotokollen").

#### Smartfactory - Human Workplace Support with AR

The [Fourth Revolution of Industry (Industry 4.0)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0) has begun. In addition to improving networking and information transparency, people are also playing a much higher role again. The human being is to be integrated again more strongly into the processes. However, the work should be ergonomic, healthy and safe. To this end, digital helpers will be used. In the first subproject of the Smartfactory, we built an industrial plant, which is built with the help of a robot from Lego bricks a figure up to a defined automation degree and is finished afterwards at a manual workstation by a human being. Which Lego bricks the worker has to grasp and how to assemble them is indicated by [Vuzix](https://www.vuzix.com/) AR glasses.

#### Augmented reality interface for controlling an industrial robot

In industry, many tasks can be automated. Above all, dangerous and tedious tasks are often handed over to robots. However, there are situations in which simple movement routines are not enough, and human judgement is necessary. In this research project, an interface was developed with which a human can control an industrial robot with natural arm movements. A [Microsoft Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) camera and a [KUKA KR6](https://www.kuka.com/de-at/produkte-leistungen/robotersysteme/industrieroboter/kr-6), as well as control components from [Phoenix Contact](https://www.phoenixcontact.com/), were used for this.
